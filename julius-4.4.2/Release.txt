===================

New features:
- Add support for per-word insertion penalty setting at grammar
  recognition. You can set different word insertion score for each word
  entry at .dict file. For example, if you have an entry
        15 [a] a
  in .dict file and want to assign word insertion score of "-2.0" to
  this word, you can write like this:
        15 @-2.0 15 [a] a
  The figure after "@" is the insertion penalty. The third
  element should be the same as the first element.

- New option "-chunk_size" can specify the audio fragment size in
  number of samples. The default value is 1000.

- At "adintool", enable input detection by default for standard input.

Fixed bugs:
- (IMPORTANT) CMN is not performed for C0 coef.  This bug exists in
  the versions from 4.1.3 to 4.2.
- "-forcedict" won't work for additional dictionaries given by "-adddict".
- Corrupted header of recorded WAV file when interrupted by CTRL+C.

  default, you can enable by using an option "-bs arg". The argument
  is score range.
- New support for PulseAudio (--with-mictype=pulseaudio)
- New Option "-adddict", "-addword" to read additional dictionaries / words.
- Portaudio library updated to V19.  Audio capture device can be
  changed by env. "PORTAUDIO_DEV_NUM".  The device list will be
  output at start up.

Changed behavior:
- "mkbinhmmlist" now saves pseudo phone list extracted from AM for
  faster start up. The output should be used with the same AM
  specified at generation.  Note that the converted binhmmlist file
  can not be used with older Julius.
- Audio library linking was modified at configure script.
  When "--with-mictype=..." is explicitly specified, Julius will link
  ONLY the audio library.  If not specified, Julius will link all the
  audio devices whose development file was detected by the configure.

Library functions:
- j_config_load_string_new(char *str): like j_config_load_file(), but
  parse the given string to set parameters.
- add_dict(), add_word(): the same as "-adddict" and "-addword".
  (They should be called at start up before starting engine)
- (portaudio/Windows) j_open_stream(recog, NUMSTR) to choose device NUM.
  ex. 'j_open_stream(recog, "1")' will open device number one.
- (portaudio/Windows) get_device_list(): obtain list of available devices.

Fixes:
- Improved tree lexicon structure for better memory management.
- Reduce malloc calls at reading N-gram.
- Eliminated memory leaks using Valgrind.

===================

New features:
 - new MSVC support: please read "msvc/00README.txt"
 - extended N-gram to support arbitrary N
 - portaudio external library (V19) can be used instead of internal V18.
   When configure detects portaudio library installed in your system, 
   Julius will use it instead of internal V18.  You can also choose
   input device by "PORTAUDIO_DEV" env. var. at V19library.  See the
   log text at start up to know how to set it.
 - allow word alignment output (-walign) in module mode

   trained by SRILM.  It will be automatically detected.  If detection
   fails, you can specify an option "-swap" in mkbingram to do that.
 - Internally modify the unigram probability of "<s>" or "</s>", since
   they may be set to "-99" in SRILM model.  The same value as
   opposite will be assigned.
[N-gram]
 - Size limit extended from 2GB to 4GB for big N-gram.
 - "<unk>" and "<UNK>" can be changed by "-mapunk".

  - perl version of jcontrol client "jclient-perl"

Modified:
  - Restrict option orders when multiple instances defined (-AM, -LM, -SR):
      - Option should be just after correspondence instance declaration. 
        (ex. LM options should be placed after "-LM" and before other 
        instance declaration.)
      - Global option should be before any instance declaration, or
        just after "-GLOBAL" option.
    This new restriction can be removed by "-nosectioncheck" option.

Fixed bugs:
  - "-record" fails to record the first silence part!

3.5.3 (2006.12.29)
===================
  o  Improved Performance:
     - acoustic computation optimized: now becomes 20%-40% faster!
     - optimize memory access: re-use work area of deleted hypothesis
       in the 2nd pass.
     - some memory allocation improvement on dictionary and word trellis.

  o  New Grammar Tools:
     - "dfa_minimize", "dfa_determinize" will minimize/determinize DFA.
        mkdfa.pl now calls dfa_mimize in it.
     - "slf2dfa": a toolkit to convert HTK slf to Julian dfa (separate kit)

  o  Embedding HTK Acoustic Parameters:
     - add option to load HTK Config file to set correct acoustic parameter
       configuration at recognition time. 
     - the acoustic parameter configuration can be embedded into
       header of a binary HMM file.

  o  Improved Word Graph:
     - add an option to completely separate graph words: words with
       different phone contexts can be output separatedly by
       "-graphrange -1".

  o  Support for online energy normalization:
     - Preliminary support for live recognition using acoustic model with
       energy normalization. (approximate with maximum energy of last input)

  o  Code refinements:
     - re-organize libsent/src/wav2mfcc.
     - modularize acoustic parameter (Value) handling.
     - output compile-time configuration of libsent with "--setting" option.

     - other small changes.


3.5.2 (2006.07.31)
===================
  o  Speed-up and improvement on Windows console:
     - Support DirectSound for better input handling
     - Support input threading utilizing callback API on portaudio.
     - Support newest MinGW (tested on 5.0.2)

  o  More accurate word graph output:
     - Add option to cut the resulting graph by its depth
       (option -graphcut, and enabled by default!)
     - Set limit for post-processing loop to avoid infinite loop
       (option -graphboundloop, and set by default)
     - Refine graph generation algorithm concerning dynamic word merging
       and search termination on the second pass.

  o  Add capability to output word graph instead of trellis on 1st pass:
     - 1st pass generates word graph instead of word trellis as
       intermediate result by specifying "--enable-word-graph".
       In that case, the 2nd pass will be restricted on the graph, not
       on the whole trellis.
     - With "--enable-word-graph" and "--enable-wpair" option, the
       first pass of Julius can perform 1-pass graph generation based
       on 2-gram with basically the same algorithm as other popular
       word graph based decoders.

  o  Bug fixes:

       can recognize waveform or microphone input with AM trained with _A.
     - Support all MFCC qualifiers (_0, _E, _N, _D, _A, _N, _Z) and their
       combination 
     - Support for any vector lenth (will be guessed from AM header)
     - New option: "-accwin"
     - New option "-zmeanframe": frame-wise DC offset removal, like HTK
     - New options to specify detailed analysis parameters (see manual):
          -preemph, -fbank, -ceplif, -rawe / -norawe, 
          -enormal / -noenormal, -escale, -silfloor

  o Improved microphone / network recognition by MAP-CMN:
     - New option "-cmnmapweight" to change MAP weight
     - Option "-cmnload" can be used to specify the initial cepstral
       mean at startup
     - Cepstral mean of last 5 second input is used as an initial mean
       for each input.  You can inhibit updating of the initial mean
       and keep the value loaded by "-cmnload" by option "-cmnnoupdate".

  o Module issue:
     - Julius now outputs "<STARTPROC/>" when recognition starts, and
       "<STOPPROC/>" after recognition stopped by module command.
       Use this for safer server-client synchronization.
     - now can specify grammar name from client by specifying a name
       after a command like "ADDGRAM name" or "CHANGEGRAM name".

  o Bug fixes:
     - Sometimes segfault on pause/resume command on module mode while input.
     - Can not read N-gram with tuples > 2^24.
     - Can not read HMM with 3-state (1 output state) model on multi-path.
     - Sometimes omit the last transition definition in DFA file.
     - Sometimes fails to compile the gramtools on MacOSX.

     - Pruning on 2nd pass based on local posterior CM (--enable-cmthres)
     - Multiple/per-grammar recognition (-gram, -gramlist, -multigramout) 
     - Can specify multiple grammars at startup: "-gram prefix1,prefix2,..."
       or "-gramlist listfile" where listfile contains list of prefixes.
     - General output character set conversion "-charconv from to"
       based on iconv (Linux) or Win32API+libjcode (Windows)

  o  Fixed bugs:
     - Not working spectral subtraction.
     - Memory leak when stack exhausted ("stack empty") on 2nd pass.
     - Segmentation fault on a very short input of 1 to 4 frames.
     - AM trained with no CMN cannot be used with waveform/mic input.
     - Wrong short-pause word handling on successive decoding mode.
       (--enable-sp-segment)
     - No output of "maxcodebooksize" at startup.
     - No output of the number of sentences found when stack exhausted.
     - No output of "-separatescore" on module mode.
     - Beam width does not adjusted when grammar has been changed and

  o  Unified source code:
     - Linux and Windows version are integrated into one source.
     - Multi-path version has been integrated with the normal version
       into one source.  The multi-path version of Julius/Julian, that
       allows any transitions of HMMs including model skip transition,
       can be compiled by "--enable-multipath" option.  The part of
       source codes for the multi-path version can be identified 
       by the definition "MULTIPATH_VERSION".

  o  Other improvements:
     - Now can be compiled on MinGW/MSYS on Windows
     - Totally rewritten comments in entire source in Doxygen format.
       You can generate fully browsable source documents in English.

       names like "julius-3.5-fast" when "make install" is invoked.
     - Updated LICENSE.txt with English translation for reference.

  o  Changed behaviors:
     - Binary N-gram file format has been changed for smaller size.
       The old files can still be read directly by julius, in which
       case on-line conversion will be performed at startup.
       You can convert the old files (3.4.2 and earlier) to the new
       format with the new mkbingram by involing the command below:
	       "mkbingram -d oldbinary newbinary"
       Please note that since mkbingram now output the new format
       file, it can not be read by older Julius.
       The binary N-gram file version can be detected by the first 17
       bytes of the file: old format should be "julius_bingram_v3" and
       new format should be "julius_bingram_v4".
     - Byte order of audio stream via tcpip fixed to LITTLE ENDIAN.
     - Now use built-in zlib by default for compressed files.  This may
       make the engine startup slower, and if you prefer, you can still
       use the previous method using external gzip command by specifying
       "--disable-zlib".
     - (Windows) Changed the compilation procedure on VC++.  You can build
       Julian by only specifying "-DBUILD_JULIAN" at compiler option,
       and do not need to alter "julius.h".

- More stable PAUSE/RESUME on module mode with adinnet input.
- Bug fixes:
  - Memory leak on very short input.
  - Missing Nth result when small vocabulary is used.

3.4.1 (2004.02.25)
===================
- AM and LM computation method is slightly modified to improve search
  stability of 2nd pass.  These modification are enabled by default, and
  MAY IMPROVE THE RECOGNITION ACCURACY as compared with older versions.
  - fixed overcounting of LM score for the expanded word.
  - new inter-word triphone approximation (-iwcd1 best #) on 1st
    pass.  This new algorithm now becomes default.
- Newly supports binary HMM (original format, not compatible with HTK).
  A tool "mkbinhmm" converts a hmmdefs(ascii) file to the binary format.
- MFCC computation becomes faster by sin/cos table lookup.
- Bugs below have been fixed:
  - (-input adinnet) recognition does not start immediately after speech
		     inputs begin when using adinnet client.
  - (-input adinnet) together with module mode, speech input cannot
		     stop by pause/terminate command.
  - (-input adinnet) unneccesary fork when connecting with adinnet client.
  - (-input rawfile) error in reading wave files created by Windows
                     sound recorder.
  - (CMN) CMN was applied any time even when acoustic models does not want.
  - (AM) numerous messages in case of missing triphone errors at startup.
  - (adintool) immediately exit after single file input.
  - (sp-segment) fixed many bugs relating short pause word and LM
  - (sp-segment) wow it works with microphone input.
  - (-[wps]align) memory leak on continuous input.
- Add option to remove DC offset from speech input (option -zmean).
- (-module) new output message:
  '<INPUTPARAM FRAMES="input_frame_length" MSEC="length_in_msec">'
- Optional feature "Search Space Visualization" is added (--enable-visualize)
- HTML documentations greatly revised in doc.

New argument: "-iwcd1 best #" "-zmean"
New configure option: "--disable-lmfix", "--enable-visualize"

3.4   (2003.10.01)
===================
- Confidence measure support
  - New parameter "-cmalpha" as smoothing coef.
  - New command "-outcode C" to output CM in module output
  - Can be disabled by configure option "--disbale-cm"
  - Can use an alternate CM algorithm by configure option "--enable-cm-nbest"
- Class N-gram support
  - Can be disabled by configure option "--disable-class-ngram"
  - Factoring basis changed from N-gram entry to dictionary word
- WAV format recording in "adinrec", "adintool" and "-record" option
- Modified output message
    startup messages,
    engine configuration message in --version and --help,
- Fixes:
    some outputs in module mode,
    bug in only several frame input (realtime-1stpass.c),
    long silence at end of segmented speech
    miscompilation with NetAudio,
    word size check in binary N-gram,
    bug in acoustic computation (gprune_none.c).
    "-version" -> "-setting", "-hipass" -> "-hifreq", "-lopass" -> "-lofreq"

3.3p4 (2003.05.06)
===================
- Fixes for audio input:
  - Fix segfault/hangup with continuous microphone input.
  - Fix client hangup when input speech too long in module mode.
    (now send an buffer overflow message to the client)
  - Fix audio input buffering for very short input (<1000 samples).
  - Fix blocking handling in tcpip adin.
- Some cosmetic changes (jcontrol, LOG_TEN, etc.)

3.3p3 (2003.01.08)
===================
- New inter-word short pause handling:
  - [Julius] New option added for short pause handling.  Specifying
    "-iwspword" adds a short-pause word entry, namely "<UNK> [sp] sp sp",
    to the dictionary.  The entry content to be changed by using "-iwspentry".
  - [multi-path] Supports inter-word context-free short pause handling.
    "-iwsp" option automatically appends a skippable short pause model at
    every word end.  The added model will also be ignored in context
    modeling.  The short pause model to be appended by "-iwsp" can be
    specified by "-spmodel" options.  See documents for details.
- Fixes for audio input:
   - Input delay improved: the initial response to mic input now
     becomes much faster than previous versions (200ms -> 50ms approx.).
   - Would not block when other process is using the audio device, but
     just output error and exit.
   - Update support for libsndfile-1.0.x.
   - Update support for ALSA-0.9.x 
     (to use this, add "--with-mictype=alsa" to configure option.)
 
3.3p2 (2002.11.18)
===================
- [multi-path version] Supports model-skip transition.  From
  this version, you can use "any" type of state transition in HTK
  format acoustic model.
- New feature: "-record dir" records speech inputs sucessively
  into the specified directory with time-stamp file names.
- fix segfault on Solaris with "-input mfcfile".
- fix blocking command input when using module mode and adinnet together.
- modified the output flush timing to make sure the last recognition
  result will be output immediately.

3.3p1 (2002.10.15)
===================
Following bugs are fixed:
- Fixed incorrect default value of language weights for second pass (-lmp2).
- Fixed sometimes read failure of dictionary file (double space enabled).
- Fixed wrong output of "-separatescore" together with monophone model.
