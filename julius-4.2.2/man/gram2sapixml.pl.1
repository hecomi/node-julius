   \- convert Julius grammar to SAPI XML grammar format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP

\fBgram2sapixml.pl\fR
converts a recognition grammar file of Julius (.grammar, .voca) to Microsoft SAPI XML grammar format.
\fIprefix\fR
should be a file name of target grammar, excluding suffixes. If multiple argument is given, each will be process sequencialy in turn.
.PP
The internal character set should be in UTF\-8 format. By default
\fBgram2sapixml.pl\fR
assume input in EUC\-JP encoding and tries to convert it to UTF\-8 using
\fBiconv\fR. You may want to disable this feature within the script.
.PP
It will fail to convert a left recursive rule in the grammar. When fails, it will leave the source rules in the target .xml file, so you should modify the output manually to solve it.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.PP
The conversion procedure is somewhat dumb one, only converting the non\-terminal symbols and terminal symbols (=word category name) into corresponding rules one by one. This is only a help tool, and you will need a manual inspection and editing to use it on a real SAPI application.
